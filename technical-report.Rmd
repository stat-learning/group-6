Your technical report should be an .Rmd file that contains the following sections. So as not to make the compilation (knitting) of the document not take too long, consider setting cache = TRUE in the curly braces of any R chunk with substantial computing. Please knit both to pdf and github document (.md).

## Abstract
**A brief overview of the area that you’ll be investigating, the research question(s) of interest, your approach to analysis, and the general conclusions.**

Overview:

Research question: Can we build classifiers to recognize what the digit (0-9) is in a given image based on 60,000 training images?

Approach to analysis:

General conclusions:

## Introduction
**Overview of the setting of the data, existing theories/models (particularly if you are working in a descriptive/inferential setting), and your research questions.**

## The Data
**Where does the data come from? How many observations? How many variables? What does each observation refer to (what is the observational unit)? What sorts of data processing was necessary to get the data in shape for analysis?**

```{r loading-data, cache=TRUE, include=FALSE}
# This part read idx files and store image data into train$x and 
# test$x in matrix form, store corresponding labels in train$y 
# and test$y in array form 
load_image_file <- function(filename) {
   ret = list()
    f = file(filename,'rb')
    readBin(f,'integer',n=1,size=4,endian='big')
    ret$n = readBin(f,'integer',n=1,size=4,endian='big')
    nrow = readBin(f,'integer',n=1,size=4,endian='big')
    ncol = readBin(f,'integer',n=1,size=4,endian='big')
    x = readBin(f,'integer',n=ret$n*nrow*ncol,size=1,signed=F)
    ret$x = matrix(x, ncol=nrow*ncol, byrow=T)
    close(f)
    ret
}

load_label_file <- function(filename) {
    f = file(filename,'rb')
    readBin(f,'integer',n=1,size=4,endian='big')
    n = readBin(f,'integer',n=1,size=4,endian='big')
    y = readBin(f,'integer',n=n,size=1,signed=F)
    close(f)
    y
}

train <- load_image_file("data/train-images-idx3-ubyte")
test <- load_image_file("data/t10k-images-idx3-ubyte")
# rescale pixels for computational reason
train$x <- train$x/255
test$x <- test$x/255

train$y <- load_label_file("data/train-labels-idx1-ubyte")
test$y <- load_label_file("data/t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte")  

train_df <- data.frame(train$y, train$x) %>%
  rename(label = train.y)
test_df <- data.frame(test$y, test$x) %>%
  rename(label = test.y)

train_df$label <- as.factor(train_df$label)
test_df$label <- as.factor(test_df$label)

```
The data comes from the MNIST database of handwritten digits. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image. 

The data is split into a training set of 60k images and a test set of 10k images. 

**Data processing**: Since the pre-downloaded data is already well-formatted, minimal effort was spent on data processing. We performed two additional steps of data processing: 

(1) Each 28x28 image was flattened into a single row of 784 pixels.

(2) All pixels were rescaled from 0-255 to 0-1. 


## Exploratory Data Analysis
**Explore the structure of the data through graphics. Here you can utilize both traditional plots as well as methods from unsupervised learning. Understanding the distribution of your response is particular important, but also investigate bivariate and higher-order relationships that you expect to be particular interesting.**

1. The digit classes are well-separated.
```{r,cache = TRUE, include=FALSE}
ggplot(train_df,aes(x = label)) + geom_histogram(stat = "count")
```
<center>
![mean](pics/freq.png)
</center>
shown by the frequency graph above, about equal amount of images for each digit. 


2. Handwriting patterns and variations.

Let's take a look at first 25 images in the training data. It's clear that those digits are centered and manipulated with 
some anti-aliasing technique. As you might observe, among six 1's below, different styles appear such as italic version and  formal version. We can say that the data set has generalization of digit styles. 
<center>
![mean](pics/first25.png)
</center>
```{r, cache=TRUE, include=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(5,5))
par(mar=c(0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1))
for (i in 1:25){
  image(matrix(train$x[i,],28)[,28:1])
}
```

Then for each digit, we average every pixels and get a mean form for each digit. 
<center>
![mean](pics/mean.png)
</center>

We calculate Euclidean distance for each image to its mean form and generate distance(to the mean) distributions for each digit. 
```{r data-preprocessing, cache= TRUE, include= FALSE}

# for each digit class, calculate the mean digit, mean distance from the mean digit and 
# variance of the distance

label <- seq(0,9) 

distance_mean <- rep(NA,10)
distance_var <- rep(NA,10)
mean_digits <- matrix(rep(0,7840),10)

par(mfrow=c(2,5))

for(i in 1:10){
  df <- train$x[train$y ==label[i],]   # create a dataframe with only the i-th digit
  mean_digit <- colMeans(df)            # get the mean form for each digit(0-9)
  mean_digits[i,] <- mean_digit         # store the mean image into mean_digits 
  dif <- sweep(df,2,mean_digit)         # store the difference for each image from its mean form 
  distance <- rowSums(dif^2)            # distance is an arrary of Euclidean distances from each image to its mean form
  distance_mean[i] <- mean(distance)
  distance_var[i] <- var(distance)
  
  # plot density of distances for each digit 
  plot(density(distance), xlab = "distance", ylab = "density", main = as.character(label[i]))
}

```
Here's the mean form for each digit. 


```{r, cache=TRUE, include=FALSE}
# Display the mean form for each digit
par(mfrow=c(2,5))
par(mar=c(0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1))
for (i in 1:10){
  image(matrix(mean_digits[i,],28)[,28:1]*255)
}
```




3. PCA & early predictions.


## Modeling
**Construct (descriptive and/or predictive) (classification and/or regression) models that address your research questions. You are encouraged to fit many different classes of models and see how they compare in terms the bias/variance tradeoff (do you have a Rashomon effect going on?). Also be sure to guard against overfitting through cross-validation or shrinkage/penalization (don’t forget about ridge regression and the lasso).**

This will be the most extensive section and will include your results as well.

- Classification Tree (with pruning)
  Our first pruned classification tree had limited success. Even without pruning, the optimal number of nodes was selected (13), and the graph of error against size showed no clear elbow indicating optimal size. The first tree could not classify the class 5 with only 13 splits, so we created a similar tree using another package that successfully modeled all classes. The important pixels (at each split) seem to be near the center of the image (around 400). The misclassification rate is near 40%, as this is a rather weak model with a limited numer of splits.

- Random Forest (with bagging)
  The plot of error against n trees shows that the pixels had variable importance in predicting the random forest. This plot also shows that as long as there are 50-100 trees, error is rather low. The mean decrease accuracy chart shows that the random forest identified 7-13 most imortant pixels, as did the simple tree. The bagged random forest (m = p) also identified a similar number of important pixels that seem to be near the center of the image. The error rate was the lowest when m=1 and the highest when m=p showing that there may be overfitting in the random forest, as it fairs better when less predictors are considered at each split.
  
- Boosted Tree
  The boosted model also identified a similar number of important pixels near the center of the image. The error rate for this model, 8%, is a little higher than the bagged random forest.
  
- Logistic Regression for Multinomial Distribution (with Ridge and Lasso)

- KNN

- SVM 

All models are cross-valiated. 


## Discussion
**Review the results generated above and sythensize them in the context from which the data originated. What do the results tell your about your original research question? Are there any weaknesses that you see in your analysis? What additional questions would you explore next?**

- 4-9 is the most difficult pair to predict across models 
- No overfitting with PCA, but some with raw data 
- Best model
- Compare with published models
