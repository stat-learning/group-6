# Digits recognition 
## Hien Nguyen,Yilin Li, Lyn Peterson
The MNIST database of handwritten digits is a classic dataset for machine learning learners. Can we build up classifiers to recognize what the digit(0-9) is in a given image based on 60,000 training images. The idea is mainly from Yann LeCun, NYU. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
