# Digits recognition 

**Group members**: Hien Nguyen, Yilin Li, Lyn Peterson

### Motivation
The MNIST database of handwritten digits is a classic dataset for machine learning learners. Can we build classifiers to recognize what the digit (0-9) is in a given image based on 60,000 training images? The data is from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
