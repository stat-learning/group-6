# Digits recognition 

**Authors**: Hien Nguyen, Yilin Li, Lyn Peterson

## Introduction

This repo contains the final project for the Statistical Learning course at Reed College taught by Andrew Bray, Fall 2019. 

### Motivation

The [MNIST database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) of handwritten digits is a classic dataset for machine learning learners. The goal of this project is to build classifiers to predict what digit (0-9) is displayed in a given image based on 60,000 training images. 

## Implementation

Different modeling methods were explored on the MNIST dataset, including:
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest (with bagging)
- Boosted Trees
- Logistic Regression
- KNN
- SVM 

The code for all models can be found under the `technical-report` folder in the `code.Rmd` file. 

## Results

Model results are reported and discussed in the `technical-report.pdf` file under the `technical-report` folder.
